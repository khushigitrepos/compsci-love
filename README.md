# CompSci Love  
## A game for CS lovers!  

When on the start screen, press enter to proceed! You'll then face the following instructions.

You're in love!...but have no idea how to tell him. Move your character to confess! Press enter to start!

...after which you'll be able to proceed to the actual game!  

In order to tell your love interest how you feel, move your character icon to the activity that you'd like to perform with him using the arrow keys.  

Your options include writing him a letter (by selecting the envelope), texting him (by selecting the message icon), going on a date (by selecting the coffee cup), or, if you're feeling timid, working on your homework together (by selecting the laptop).  

Your love interest's heart might seem ice cold, but with the right activity, even his heart can thaw for you! But can you solve the mystery while you have attention? Make sure to pay attention to his interest meter in the top left corner!

Once you've conquered the game, you'll know. But if you feel like you're making a mistake, feel free to restart at any time by clicking on the back button!  

Best of luck, and we hope you win his heart over!
